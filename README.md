# Welcome to my GitHub. I'm Eunice!
I have a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science and a strong passion for Tech Support and Cloud Computing.

## Objective

Here I am going to link repositories of projects that I have worked on once I am done updating them.

## Tools and Technologies
Here I will list down tools and technologies I have used, and ones that I am skilled in.
